# Build your own radar as code

Thoughtworks tech radar is a great way to spread knowledge, visualize entropy and align teams.

Several people advocate to companies to implement their own internal radar which can be an easy task provided the
 simple Thoughtworks build-your-own-radar website which is feeded by a google spreadsheet. Several companies have
  implemented their own code to build their radar as wel.
 
However, all of them apparently focus on the visualization/creation process, not in a process of sharing the knowledge
/building the radar in an inclusive and iterative way.
  
Here is some experimentation of having a github as an easily editable source of the radar and use all the beaut of
 pull requests, pipelines, snapshots, releases and of course github pages ;).

For some personal extra thoughts about knowledge sharing and previous experience checkout this [blog post]()
