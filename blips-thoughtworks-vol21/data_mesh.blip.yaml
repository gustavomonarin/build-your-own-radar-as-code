  <p><strong><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html">Data mesh</a></strong> is an
  architectural paradigm that unlocks analytical data at scale; rapidly unlocking access to an ever-growing number of
  distributed domain data sets, for a proliferation of consumption scenarios such as machine learning, analytics or data
  intensive applications across the organization. Data mesh addresses the common failure modes of the traditional
  centralized <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DataLake.html">data lake</a> or data platform architecture,
  with a shift from the centralized paradigm of a lake, or its predecessor, the data warehouse. Data mesh shifts to a
  paradigm that draws from modern distributed architecture: considering domains as the first-class concern, applying
  platform thinking to create a self-serve data infrastructure, treating data as a product and implementing open
  standardization to enable an ecosystem of interoperable distributed data products.</p>
